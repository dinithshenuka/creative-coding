Blossom allows users to interact with the window in a playful way to create a shower of flowers. 
Here's how it works:
Clicking: A single click anywhere on the screen will make a flower gently drop down, one at a time.
Dragging: By dragging the mouse or finger across the window, users can continuously "plant" flowers along their path, creating a trail of blooms.
Touchscreen Compatibility: Blossom seamlessly adapts to touchscreens, providing an intuitive and enjoyable experience for all users.
